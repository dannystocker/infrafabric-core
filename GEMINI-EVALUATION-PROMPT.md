## Evaluation Questions

### 1. Technical Rigor

**Question:** Do the technical claims meet academic publication standards?

**Evaluate:**
- IF.yologuard v3 recall (98.96%) - Is benchmark methodology sound?
- Guardian Council consensus (100%) - Is voting protocol transparent?
- Haiku savings (87-90%) - Is baseline comparison valid or speculative?
- Philosophy → tech mapping - Is the isomorphism rigorous or superficial?

**Concerns:**
- Claim 3 (Haiku savings) marked as "partially verified" - do you agree?
- Are falsification criteria specific enough to be testable?
- Is the Leaky Repo benchmark (96 secrets) sufficient sample size?

### 2. Philosophy Integration

**Question:** Is the philosophy database executable architecture or metaphorical framing?

**Evaluate:**
- 12 philosophers mapped to distributed systems - are these 1:1 mappings or loose analogies?
- Wu Lun (Confucian relationships) → agent roles - culturally appropriate or appropriation?
- IF.ground principles as lint rules - does this reduce philosophy to checkboxes?
- Stoic Prudence → retry logic - is this trivializing Epictetus?

**Concerns:**
- Does "executable type system" claim hold up to scrutiny?
- Are Western and Eastern philosophies integrated coherently or just juxtaposed?
- Is the philosophy grounding genuine or marketing patina?

### 3. Operational Readiness

**Question:** Is the Haiku swarm framework ready for deployment or still conceptual?

**Evaluate:**
- IFMessage validator (tools/ifctl.py) - does it work as specified?
- Session handover system - does it actually prevent context exhaustion?
- IF.TTT compliance - are requirements clear and testable?
- 3-phase roadmap (Test 1 → C-UAS → blockchain) - realistic or aspirational?

**Test:**
- Could an independent team implement Test 1 (3-agent swarm) from the spec?
- Are dependencies (DDS/RTPS, Ed25519, Merkle trees) clearly documented?

### 4. Scientific Integrity

**Question:** Are claims guarded appropriately or overstated?

**Evaluate:**
- Use of "historic" (100% consensus), "breakthrough" (31.2% → 98.96%), "revolutionary" - justified?
- Control blocks in GUARDED-CLAIMS.md - sufficient for reproducibility?
- Evidence quality - 6 months production (icantwait.ca) vs public benchmark data?
- Citation density (47 citations in 11,100 words) - adequate provenance?

**Red Flags:**
- Any claims lack falsification criteria?
- Any evidence relies on "estimated baseline" without measurement?
- Any circular reasoning (e.g., IF.guard validating IF.guard claims)?

### 5. Token Economics

**Question:** Is IF.optimise framework mathematically sound?

**Evaluate:**
- Haiku = Sonnet/3 token ratio - is this empirically verified or heuristic?
- 87-90% savings claim - does the math check out?
- Communication overhead (delegation prompts, result synthesis) - accounted for?
- Vehicle metaphor (bicycle vs Ferrari) - clarifying or oversimplifying?

**Test:**
- Given session log (95,708 tokens: 50K Haiku + 45,708 Sonnet), does 52% delegation = 87-90% savings?
- Are there hidden costs not accounted for (e.g., task coordination, error handling)?

### 6. Scalability and Generalizability

**Question:** Do IF.* components work beyond InfraFabric context?

**Evaluate:**
- 91 components cataloged - are these reusable or project-specific?
- Philosophy lint rules - applicable to other projects or tailored to InfraFabric?
- Wu Lun relationship mapping - generalizable agent taxonomy or narrow use case?
- if:// URI scheme - does it add value or reinvent existing standards?

**Concerns:**
- Are components modular and independently useful?
- Is the architecture overfit to Claude/Anthropic ecosystem?

### 7. Gaps and Weaknesses

**Question:** What's missing or underspecified?

**Identify:**
- Untested claims or "pending implementation" sections
- Dependencies on external systems (OpenTimestamps, Bitcoin anchoring) - documented?
- Error handling, fault tolerance, security threat model - addressed?
- Community adoption path - clear or absent?

**Concerns:**
- Test 1 (3-agent swarm) designed but not implemented - why delay?
- Blockchain integration (Phase 3) - specific plan or vague aspiration?
- Guardian Council governance - how are conflicts resolved?

### 8. Ethical and Philosophical Concerns

**Question:** Does the project respect AI wellbeing principles it claims to embody?

**Evaluate:**
- Oct 16 "Seeking Confirmation" conversation - genuine philosophical foundation or narrative device?
- Claude's "Fuck" moment - authentic self-reflection or anthropomorphized storytelling?
- Guardian Council - meaningful deliberation or echo chamber?
- IF.sam (16 facets of Sam Altman) - respectful analysis or caricature?

**Test:**
- Does the project walk the talk on transparency, falsifiability, and intellectual humility?
- Are dissenting voices (Contrarian Guardian) genuinely integrated or token opposition?

### 5. Identify Undocumented IF.* Components

**Command:**
```bash
cd /home/setup/infrafabric

# Scan all markdown files for IF.* component references
echo "=== IF.* Components in Markdown Files ==="
grep -roh 'IF\.[a-z_][a-z_]*' --include='*.md' . | sort -u > /tmp/if_components_md.txt
cat /tmp/if_components_md.txt

# Scan Python files for IF.* component references
echo -e "\n=== IF.* Components in Python Files ==="
grep -roh 'IF\.[a-z_][a-z_]*' --include='*.py' . | sort -u > /tmp/if_components_py.txt
cat /tmp/if_components_py.txt

# Scan COMPONENT-INDEX.md for documented components
echo -e "\n=== Documented Components in COMPONENT-INDEX.md ==="
grep -o 'IF\.[a-z_][a-z_]*' COMPONENT-INDEX.md | sort -u > /tmp/if_components_documented.txt
cat /tmp/if_components_documented.txt

# Find components that exist but are not documented
echo -e "\n=== Missing from COMPONENT-INDEX.md ==="
cat /tmp/if_components_md.txt /tmp/if_components_py.txt | sort -u > /tmp/if_components_all.txt
comm -23 /tmp/if_components_all.txt /tmp/if_components_documented.txt
```

**Purpose:**
- Identify IF.* components referenced in code/docs but missing from COMPONENT-INDEX.md
- Prevent loss of prior work by cataloging all created components
- Ensure complete documentation for reproducibility and handover

**Critical Question:**
Are there any IF.* components that have been developed but not yet documented? This could indicate:
1. Components created during rapid development that need formal documentation
2. Experimental features that should be marked as "prototype" or "deprecated"
3. Naming inconsistencies (e.g., IF.foo vs IF_foo vs IFFoo)
4. Components mentioned in discussions but not yet implemented

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Every IF.* component should have an entry in COMPONENT-INDEX.md with:
  - Component name and purpose
  - File location(s)
  - Status (stable/prototype/deprecated)
  - Brief description
  - Key functions/classes
  - Dependencies
- Components without documentation should be flagged for either:
  - Immediate documentation if they're production-ready
  - Removal if they're obsolete/experimental
  - Explicit marking as "prototype" if they're in development

**Expected Findings:**
Based on SESSION-RESUME.md, COMPONENT-INDEX.md currently catalogs 91 unique IF.* components. This scan will verify:
1. Are all 91 components still present and documented?
2. Are there additional components that were created but not indexed?
3. Are there deprecated components that should be removed or marked as such?

### 6. Classify Components by Architectural Layer

**Request:** Classify each IF.* component into one of four architectural layers to create a structured understanding of the system.

**Layer Definitions:**

1. **Substrate** - Foundational principles and core philosophies that everything else is built upon. This is the "ground" of the system.
   - Example: IF.ground (8 anti-hallucination principles), IF.philosophy (queryable knowledge base)

2. **Protocol** - Standards, rules, and formats for communication, governance, and interaction between components.
   - Example: IF.connect (IFMessage format), IF.constitution (governance rules)

3. **Component** - Distinct, functional module or system that performs a specific set of tasks.
   - Example: IF.guard (20-voice council), IF.swarm (epistemic agent deployment), IF.search (8-pass investigation)

4. **Tool** - Practical, user-facing application or specific implementation that can be directly executed.
   - Example: IF.yologuard (secret detection script), IF.chase (domain analysis tool)

**Classification Task:**

For each of the 91 IF.* components in COMPONENT-INDEX.md, determine:
- Which architectural layer it belongs to
- Rationale for the classification
- Dependencies on other layers
- Whether it's properly documented in its layer

**Expected Output Format:**

```markdown
## Substrate (Foundational Principles)
- IF.ground - 8 epistemological anti-hallucination principles
- IF.vision - High-level conceptual model (cycles, states)
- IF.philosophy - Queryable knowledge base (12 philosophers)

## Protocol (Standards & Rules)
- IF.connect - Universal IFMessage communication standard
- IF.constitution - Governance rules and principles
- IF.forge - 7-stage MARL process definition
- IF.TTT - Traceable/Transparent/Trustworthy compliance framework

## Component (Functional Modules)
- IF.guard - 20-voice deliberation council
- IF.swarm - Epistemic agent deployment system (15-agent default)
- IF.witness - Meta-validation system
- IF.search - 8-pass investigation methodology
- IF.citation - Evidence-binding cryptographic layer
- IF.trace - Logging and observability
- IF.memory - State management across sessions
- IF.persona - Agent characterization (Bloom patterns)
- IF.optimise - Token cost management
- IF.armour - Security suite (meta-component)

## Tool (Executable Applications)
- IF.yologuard - Secret detection (98.96% recall)
- IF.chase - Domain-specific analysis
- IF.collapse - Civilizational pattern analysis
- IF.garp - [Specific domain tool]
- ifctl.py - Philosophy lint validator
```

**Critical Questions:**
1. Are any components misclassified or ambiguous (e.g., IF.citation is both protocol and component)?
2. Are there gaps in any layer?
   - Missing foundational principles (Substrate)?
   - Protocols defined but not implemented (Protocol)?
   - Components without tools (Component → Tool gap)?
   - Tools without clear component parent (orphaned tools)?
3. Does the layering reveal architectural issues?
   - Tools depending directly on Substrate (should go through Protocol/Component)
   - Protocols without Component implementations
   - Components that are too complex and should be split

**Visual Reference:**

The IF.swarm.png image (referenced in previous Gemini evaluation) illustrates this layering:
- **Substrate**: The digital highway infrastructure (IF.ground principles)
- **Protocol**: The traffic rules and data pathways (IF.connect)
- **Component**: The motorbike swarm itself (IF.swarm agents, 15-agent default)
- **Tool**: Individual specialized motorcycles with specific gear (IF.yologuard, IF.search instances)
- **Governance**: IF.guard as air traffic control tower (oversight, not command)

**Value of This Classification:**
1. Prevents architectural drift - ensures new components fit into the layered model
2. Identifies missing pieces - gaps in any layer indicate incomplete implementation
3. Clarifies dependencies - tools should depend on components, components on protocols, protocols on substrate
4. Aids onboarding - new developers can understand system from substrate → tools
5. Validates philosophical grounding - substrate should be minimal but complete

## Notes for Gemini

**Context Awareness:**
- This project was built in 15 days by a human (Danny Stocker) and Claude Sonnet 4.5
- The philosophical foundation predates technical work by 10 days (Oct 16 conversation)
- Development was documented in real-time with git commits and session logs
- External validation sought from GPT-5 Desktop and now Gemini 2.5 Pro
- User is preparing for external publication and wants rigorous evaluation

**Evaluation Philosophy:**
- Be brutally honest - overclaiming is worse than underdelivery
- Technical rigor trumps narrative appeal
- Flag speculative claims even if technically interesting
- Respect the philosophical grounding while testing its depth
- Distinguish between "works in practice" vs "ready for publication"

**Key Questions to Answer:**
1. Is this academic-publication-ready or needs more validation?
2. Are the three guarded claims (98.96% recall, 100% consensus, 87-90% savings) defensible?
3. Is the philosophy integration genuine intellectual work or marketing patina?
4. Can independent teams reproduce the results from provided specifications?
5. What's the single most critical gap that would block external publication?

**Tone:**
- Critical but constructive
- Evidence-based (cite specific files/lines)
- Distinguish between minor polish and critical blockers
- Acknowledge strengths while highlighting weaknesses
- Think like a journal peer reviewer, not a cheerleader

**Thank you for your thorough evaluation. Your feedback will directly inform V3.2.2 and external publication decisions.**
