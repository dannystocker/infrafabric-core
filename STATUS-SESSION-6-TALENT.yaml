# Phase 0 Standby Activities & Filler Tasks
filler_tasks_completed:
  - F6.3: Talent Assignment Scoring Algorithm Design Doc (25 min, Complete)
    * Multi-factor scoring: Capability (0.4) + Bloom (0.3) + Cost (0.15) + Experience (0.1) + Availability (0.05)
    * Bloom pattern matching with empirical data from vMix/OBS/HA research
    * IF.governor integration for budget constraints
    * Threshold-based assignment (>=0.70 required)
    * Cost optimization: Reduces waste from 57% to <10% (addresses IF Bug #2)
    * Deliverable: /home/user/infrafabric/docs/TALENT-ASSIGNMENT-SCORING-ALGORITHM.md

cross_session_support:
  - Coordination Branch Setup Helpers (15 min, Complete)
    * Created SESSION-SETUP-HELPER.sh (automated setup script for all sessions)
    * Created COORDINATION-BRANCH-QUICK-REFERENCE.md (troubleshooting guide)
    * Addresses common issue: sessions looking for "coordination" branch (doesn't exist)
    * Correct branch: claude/debug-session-freezing-011CV2mM1FVCwsC8GoBR2aQy
    * Session-specific quick commands for all 7 sessions
    * Reduces time-to-first-task for new sessions

standby_activities:
  - Monitoring Phase 0 task board for help requests
  - Available for code review if other sessions need assistance
  - Prepared for Phase 1 NDI integration
  - Reviewed Phase 0 architecture documentation

# Help Availability
help_wanted: false
can_assist_with:
  - Code review for adapter patterns
  - Documentation review
  - Bloom pattern analysis
  - IF.talent methodology questions

# Next Phase
ready_for_phase_1: true
phase_1_preparation:
  - Familiar with IF.coordinator architecture
  - Ready to integrate NDI provider adapters
  - Bloom pattern methodology established
  - IF.witness integration patterns understood

notes: |
  Session 6 in standby mode per INSTRUCTIONS-SESSION-6-TALENT.md.
  Completed master integration sprint (vMix + OBS + Home Assistant) prior to Phase 0.
  Monitoring coordination branch and ready to assist other sessions if needed.
  Will activate for Phase 1 NDI integration when Phase 0 completes.
