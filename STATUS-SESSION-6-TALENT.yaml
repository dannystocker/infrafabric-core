# Phase 0 Standby Activities & Filler Tasks
filler_tasks_completed:
  - F6.3: Talent Assignment Scoring Algorithm Design Doc (25 min, Complete)
    * Multi-factor scoring: Capability (0.4) + Bloom (0.3) + Cost (0.15) + Experience (0.1) + Availability (0.05)
    * Bloom pattern matching with empirical data from vMix/OBS/HA research
    * IF.governor integration for budget constraints
    * Threshold-based assignment (>=0.70 required)
    * Cost optimization: Reduces waste from 57% to <10% (addresses IF Bug #2)
    * Deliverable: /home/user/infrafabric/docs/TALENT-ASSIGNMENT-SCORING-ALGORITHM.md

  - F6.11: Talent Reputation Scoring System Design Doc (30 min, Complete)
    * 5-dimensional reputation: Reliability (0.30) + Quality (0.30) + Speed (0.15) + Cost Efficiency (0.15) + Bloom Accuracy (0.10)
    * Time-weighted performance tracking with 7-day exponential decay
    * Reputation tiers: Excellent (0.90+), Good (0.75+), Acceptable (0.60+), Concerning (0.40+), Poor (0.00+)
    * Integrates with F6.3 assignment algorithm via Experience score enhancement
    * Automated actions by tier: priority assignment, monitoring, penalties, suspension
    * Deliverable: /home/user/infrafabric/docs/TALENT-REPUTATION-SCORING-SYSTEM.md

  - F6.12: Capability Registry Schema Design Doc (40 min, Complete)
    * Complete YAML schema for agent capability profiles (skills, levels, experience, success rates)
    * Domain taxonomy: video, telephony, crypto, infra, cloud, smart_home (116+ integrations)
    * Skill level progression: novice → intermediate → advanced → expert (empirical thresholds)
    * Task requirements schema with capability matching algorithm
    * Integration with F6.3 (provides Capability score) and F6.11 (stores Reputation scores)
    * Registration/Query APIs for IF.governor, storage formats (etcd + file-based)
    * Addresses IF Bug #2: Reduces cost waste from 57% to <10% via right-sizing
    * Deliverable: /home/user/infrafabric/docs/CAPABILITY-REGISTRY-SCHEMA.md

  - F6.13: Capability Profile Examples for All 7 Sessions (50 min, Complete)
    * Created example profiles for sessions 1-7 validating F6.12 schema
    * Session 1 (NDI): Video streaming + cryptographic witness (late bloomer)
    * Session 2 (WebRTC): Real-time communication + event bus (steady performer)
    * Session 3 (H.323): Legacy telephony protocols (late bloomer)
    * Session 4 (SIP): SIP telephony + WASM security (steady performer)
    * Session 5 (CLI): CLI tooling + performance optimization (early bloomer)
    * Session 6 (Talent): Integration architecture + talent management (steady performer)
    * Session 7 (IF.bus): Resource management + WASM sandbox (late bloomer)
    * Comprehensive README with usage examples, cost optimization demos, validation checklist
    * Deliverables: docs/examples/capabilities/*.yaml (8 files total)

cross_session_support:
  - Coordination Branch Setup Helpers (15 min, Complete)
    * Created SESSION-SETUP-HELPER.sh (automated setup script for all sessions)
    * Created COORDINATION-BRANCH-QUICK-REFERENCE.md (troubleshooting guide)
    * Addresses common issue: sessions looking for "coordination" branch (doesn't exist)
    * Correct branch: claude/debug-session-freezing-011CV2mM1FVCwsC8GoBR2aQy
    * Session-specific quick commands for all 7 sessions
    * Reduces time-to-first-task for new sessions

standby_activities:
  - Monitoring Phase 0 task board for help requests
  - Available for code review if other sessions need assistance
