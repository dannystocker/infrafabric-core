## Meta-Evaluation Question

**The Big Question:**

InfraFabric claims to transform "philosophy into infrastructure" and these narrative documents are supposed to demonstrate that methodology in action.

**Do these narratives successfully demonstrate:**
1. **Philosophy → Code:** Are philosophical principles operationalized?
2. **Theory → Practice:** Is the implementation gap bridged?
3. **Evidence → Story:** Is epistemological rigor maintained while telling engaging stories?
4. **IF.TTT in Action:** Do the narratives themselves embody Traceable, Transparent, Trustworthy principles?

**Your verdict:** YES / PARTIALLY / NO
**Your reasoning:** [3-5 paragraphs]

- Output: ~8K tokens (comprehensive evaluation)
- Total: ~58K tokens (well within Gemini 2M context window)

---

## Success Criteria for This Evaluation

**This evaluation is successful if it:**
1. ✅ Identifies concrete strengths (what works well)
2. ✅ Identifies concrete weaknesses (what needs improvement)
3. ✅ Provides actionable recommendations (not vague suggestions)
4. ✅ Validates or challenges IF.TTT compliance claims
5. ✅ Assesses whether narrative methodology is sound
6. ✅ Gives a clear verdict: publication-ready or needs work

---

## Context for Gemini: What You're Evaluating

This is NOT just "documentation" - this is an attempt to:
- Transform dry technical research into compelling narratives
- Maintain perfect epistemological rigor (IF.TTT) while storytelling
- Demonstrate that "philosophy as infrastructure" is real (not just theory)
- Create models for how AI systems should communicate (transparent, traceable, trustworthy)

**The stakes:** If this works, it's a blueprint for how AI research should be communicated. If it doesn't, it's philosophy theater that wastes everyone's time.

**Your job:** Tell us which one it is, and why.

---

## Final Note

**Be brutally honest.**

We don't want validation - we want TRUTH. If something is weak, say so. If a claim is unjustified, call it out. If the narrative is boring, tell us why.

The goal is to make this work EXCELLENT, not to feel good about it.

**Gemini, your evaluation begins now. 🚀**
