# agents.md — Quick Context for AI Sessions

**Status:** 📝 Under development

**Purpose:** This file provides essential context for AI sessions joining InfraFabric development.

## What This File Will Contain:

- **Project Goal:** One-paragraph summary of InfraFabric's mission
- **Current Phase Focus:** What we're building right now (Phase 0, Phase 1, etc.)
- **Coordination Protocol:**
  - Branch naming conventions
  - Task board locations
  - Polling cadence
  - Status update format
- **Active Work:** "Do/Don't touch" list for in-flight work
- **Session Roles:** Who handles what (NDI, WebRTC, H.323, SIP, CLI, Talent, IF.bus)
- **Communication Patterns:** How sessions coordinate with each other
- **Emergency Contacts:** How to escalate blockers

## Interim Guidance:

Until this file is fully populated, new AI sessions should:

1. **Read first:** `PHASE-0-TASK-BOARD.md` for current work
2. **Check status:** `AUTONOMOUS-NEXT-TASKS.md` for available tasks
3. **Understand context:** `INTEGRATION-ROADMAP-POST-GPT5-REVIEW.md` for big picture
4. **Review coordination:** `papers/claude/COORDINATION-NARRATIVE.md` for lessons learned

## Development Note:

This stub exists to ensure documentation links don't 404. The full `agents.md` will be populated as part of Phase 0 documentation deliverables.
