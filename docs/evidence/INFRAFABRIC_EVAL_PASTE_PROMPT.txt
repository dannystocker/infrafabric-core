# InfraFabric Comprehensive Evaluation

I'm the developer of InfraFabric (https://github.com/dannystocker/infrafabric), a research project on AI agent coordination and civilizational resilience. I need a brutally honest, multi-phase evaluation.

## Your Mission

**Phase 1: Survey & Strategy**
1. Clone the repository and analyze structure
2. Propose a segmentation strategy for multi-session review (manage context windows)
3. Start with `/papers/` directory to understand conceptual foundation

**Phase 2: Comprehensive Evaluation** (across multiple sessions if needed)

For each segment, assess:

**A. Conceptual Quality**
- Substance: Grounded research or speculation?
- Novelty: What's genuinely new?
- Rigor: Are claims verifiable and traceable?
- Coherence: Do ideas connect or drift?

**B. Technical Implementation**
- Code quality (architecture, security, performance, tests)
- **IF.* Component Inventory:**
  - ✅ Fully implemented (with file paths)
  - 🟡 Designed but not built
  - ❌ Vaporware (mentioned but no spec/code)
- Dependencies and infrastructure requirements

**B.1. Citation & Documentation Verification (CRITICAL)**
- **Verify all papers in `/papers/` directory:**
  - Check every citation is traceable (DOI, URL, or file reference)
  - Flag claims without supporting evidence
  - Check if citations are current (papers from last 3 years = bonus, 10+ years old = flag for review)
  - Verify external URLs are not 404 (check at least 10 random citations)
- **README.md audit:**
  - Does it accurately reflect current codebase state?
  - Are install instructions up-to-date and correct?
  - Do all links work?
  - Is project description aligned with actual implementation?
  - Are examples/screenshots current?

**C. Market Fit**
- What problems does this solve?
- Who would buy this? (Rank top 3 buyer personas)
- Viable business model?
- Competitive landscape

**D. Style & Presentation**
- Documentation quality and accessibility
- Narrative coherence
- Jargon density

## Deliverables

**1. Evaluation Report** with:
- Executive summary (1 page)
- Conceptual foundation analysis
- Technical architecture review (IF.* component status)
- Market & utility analysis (who would buy this, why)
- Gap analysis (what's missing)
- Style assessment

**2. Debug Session Prompt** (separate file) containing:
- IF.* component status (implemented/partial/missing)
- Foundational gaps inventory
- P0/P1/P2 prioritized issues
- Step-by-step debug workflow

## Context Window Strategy

To prevent information loss:
- Create `EVALUATION_PROGRESS.md` tracking:
  - Segments reviewed
  - Key findings per segment
  - IF.* component inventory
  - Running gap list
- Each session: Read EVALUATION_PROGRESS.md → Review new segment → Update files

## Critical Questions

**Strategic:**
- Is this a product, research project, or marketing deck?
- What's the fastest path to demonstrable value?
- Would the top 3 buyer personas actually pay?
- Production-ready, prototype, or concept-only?

**Technical:**
- Ratio of docs to working code?
- Any complete, end-to-end features?
- External dependencies?
- Coherent architecture or collection of experiments?

**Market:**
- Total addressable market (TAM)?
- Go-to-market strategy?
- Existing competitors?
- What's unique and defensible?

**Format Requirements:**
- **Be brutally honest** (I need truth, not validation)
- **Use exact YAML schema above** (makes diff/merge trivial)
- **Quantify everything** (0-10 scores, percentages, counts, effort estimates)
- **Cite specific files/lines** (file:line format for traceability)
- **Flag vaporware clearly** (implemented/partial/vaporware categories)
- **All findings must be actionable** (include fix/effort estimates)

## Starting Point

Begin with `/papers/` directory to understand conceptual foundation, then propose next segments.

**Ready to begin. Please start with repository survey and `/papers/` analysis.**
