================================================================================
CRITICAL QUESTIONS (Answer These)
================================================================================

QUESTION 1: Core Claim Verification
============================================
CLAIM: "IF.yologuard v3 detected 95/96 secrets on Leaky Repo (99% recall)"

Your Assessment:
- [ ] Is this claim verified/reproducible? (YES/NO/PARTIAL)
- [ ] What is the evidence quality? (STRONG/MODERATE/WEAK)
- [ ] Can any reviewer independently verify this? (YES/NO)
- [ ] What is the confidence in this metric? (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)

Why this matters: This is the core empirical result. If this can't be verified,
the entire paper is questionable.


QUESTION 2: Precision Claims
============================================
CLAIM: "100% precision (zero false positives)"

Your Assessment:
- [ ] Is this claim proven or preliminary? (PROVEN/PRELIMINARY/UNVERIFIED)
- [ ] What validation is missing? (List gaps)
- [ ] Should this be published as "100% precision"? (YES/NO)
- [ ] What should we say instead? (Suggested language)

Critical consideration: The audit document notes this is pending manual review.
Does the paper make this clear?


QUESTION 3: Technical Soundness
============================================
EVALUATION: Is the 4-stage pipeline algorithm sound?

Your Assessment:
- [ ] Pattern matching: Sound? (YES/NO/QUESTIONABLE)
- [ ] Entropy detection: Sound? (YES/NO/QUESTIONABLE)
- [ ] Format decoding: Sound? (YES/NO/QUESTIONABLE)
- [ ] Relationship validation: Sound? (YES/NO/QUESTIONABLE)
- [ ] Overall architecture: Sound? (YES/NO/QUESTIONABLE)

Critical consideration: An unsound algorithm could produce misleading results.
Are there any architectural flaws?


QUESTION 4: Evidence Quality
============================================
ASSESSMENT: What is the overall quality of evidence presented?

Your Assessment:
- [ ] Are claims supported by evidence? (YES/MOSTLY/NO)
- [ ] Are limitations honestly stated? (YES/MOSTLY/NO)
- [ ] Are disclaimers sufficient? (YES/MOSTLY/NO)
- [ ] Is methodology transparent? (YES/MOSTLY/NO)
- [ ] Are results reproducible? (YES/MOSTLY/NO)

Critical consideration: Research integrity depends on honest reporting.


QUESTION 5: Credibility Gaps
============================================
ASSESSMENT: The audit document identifies 5 credibility gaps.

Your Assessment:
- [ ] Are these gaps real problems? (YES/SOME/NO)
- [ ] Are remediation plans achievable? (YES/LIKELY/UNLIKELY)
- [ ] What is the priority of remediation? (CRITICAL/IMPORTANT/NICE-TO-HAVE)
- [ ] Should publication wait for remediation? (YES/NO/EITHER)

Critical consideration: Major gaps could undermine publication credibility.


QUESTION 6: Trust Rating Assessment
============================================
CURRENT ASSESSMENT: 7/10 (as stated in audit)

Your Assessment:
- [ ] Is 7/10 too high? (Much too high / Slightly high / About right / Slightly low / Too low)
- [ ] Justify your rating: [Your assessment]
- [ ] What would raise it to 8/10? [Specific actions]
- [ ] What would lower it to 6/10? [What would concern you]

Critical consideration: Is the stated rating justified?


QUESTION 7: Philosophical Framing
============================================
ASSESSMENT: The paper uses Confucian "Wu Lun" (Five Relationships) framing

Your Assessment:
- [ ] Is this framing helpful or misleading? (HELPFUL/NEUTRAL/MISLEADING)
- [ ] Does it accurately describe the technical approach? (YES/PARTIALLY/NO)
- [ ] Should it be toned down? (YES/NO)
- [ ] Suggested revision: [If applicable]

Critical consideration: Philosophical language should not obscure technical reality.


QUESTION 8: Publishing Readiness
============================================
ASSESSMENT: Should this work be published now, or wait for more validation?

Your Assessment:
- [ ] Ready to publish now? (YES / WAIT 2-3 WEEKS / NOT YET)
- [ ] If publishing now, what caveats are essential? [List]
- [ ] If waiting, what specific validation is critical? [List]
- [ ] Recommended title/framing: [Suggested]

Critical consideration: Publication timing affects credibility and impact.


QUESTION 9: Comparison with Standards
============================================
ASSESSMENT: How does this work compare to industry standards?

Your Assessment:
- [ ] Compared to academic papers: (ABOVE AVERAGE / AVERAGE / BELOW AVERAGE)
- [ ] Compared to industry tools: (SUPERIOR / COMPARABLE / INFERIOR)
- [ ] For publication venue: (READY FOR TOP-TIER / READY FOR GOOD / NEEDS IMPROVEMENT)
- [ ] Confidence in assessment: (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW)

Critical consideration: Missing cross-tool comparison is a real gap.


QUESTION 10: Overall Credibility Assessment
============================================
FINAL ASSESSMENT: Your trust rating for this work

Your Assessment:
- [ ] My trust rating: ___/10 (0-10 scale)
- [ ] Justification: [Explain your rating]
- [ ] Key strengths: [List 3-5]
- [ ] Key weaknesses: [List 3-5]
- [ ] Critical open questions: [List any concerns]

================================================================================
KEY CONTEXT (For Your Assessment)
================================================================================

1. WHAT IS THIS?
   A relationship-based secret detection system (like GitGuardian/Gitleaks but
   using contextual heuristics instead of pure pattern matching)

2. CLAIMED CONTRIBUTION
   Novel "Wu Lun" relationship validation that achieves 99% recall with lower
   false positives than pattern-matching approaches

3. CURRENT STATUS
   Prototype stage, validated on single benchmark (Leaky Repo), claims exceed
   current validation evidence

4. TRUST CONTEXT
   Authors have provided honest credibility audit (Annex D) identifying gaps
   and remediation plan. This is unusual in research - most don't acknowledge
   limitations so clearly.

5. YOUR ROLE
   Independent verification - determine if claims are credible and if work
   is ready for publication

================================================================================
IMPORTANT NOTES
================================================================================

- This assessment should be done WITHOUT bias toward the authors
- Your job is to verify claims independently, not to approve/reject
- If something is unclear, say so - don't assume
- The credibility audit (Annex D) is provided as reference context, not as
  "the answer" - make your own judgment
- You are evaluating credibility and publication readiness, not perfection
- All work has gaps - the question is whether gaps are acceptable

================================================================================
THANK YOU FOR YOUR REVIEW
================================================================================

Your independent assessment of this work is valuable for:
- Validating that the 7/10 trust rating is appropriate
- Identifying any gaps missed by internal review
- Determining publication readiness
- Assessing whether remediation plan is sufficient
- Establishing credibility with academic/research community

This package was designed to enable ANY AI system to independently verify
the claims without vendor lock-in. Your assessment helps validate this goal.
