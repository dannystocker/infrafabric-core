# Run Executive Summary

**Run ID:** `run-20251101-001832`

## Philosophy

*"Every run is an experiment. Every experiment teaches."*

This run demonstrates InfraFabric's weighted coordination principles:
- **Reciprocity**: Agents earn influence through contribution
- **Exploration**: Failed agents silent (0.0 weight), no system penalty
- **Amplification**: Successful contribution amplified (up to 2.0x)
- **Late Bloomers**: Patience reveals maturation patterns

---

## TL;DR

- Processed **84 contacts** using **weighted coordination** with 7 agents
- **100% handled by free agents** (saved $0.420 vs naive approach)
- Validated weighted coordination: failed exploration silent, successful contribution amplified

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Value | Philosophy |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **contacts_processed** | 84 | Scale validates theory |
| **free_agents_sufficient** | 84 | Free > expensive when quality sufficient |
| **google_validations_needed** | 0 | Expensive validation targeted |
| **cost_saved** | 0.42000000000000026 | Thrift is a virtue |
| **system_score** | 0.0 | Unified quality measure |
