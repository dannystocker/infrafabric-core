    "timestamp": "2025-10-31T21:43:23.589566",
    "summary": "\nProposal to add a meta-cognitive layer that steps outside the search problem to debug and reframe:\n\n**Three Meta-Agents:**\n1. MetaDebuggerAgent - Analyzes why searches fail, asks Socratic questions\n2. CreativeStrategistAgent - Generates creative reframings via oblique strategies\n3. PerspectiveShifterAgent - Searches from different personas (Recruiter, Journalist, etc.)\n\n**Trigger:** Meta-layer only invoked when primary agents return low confidence (<50%)\n\n**Creative Strategies:**\n- Temporal searches (Internet Archive)\n- Inverse searches (who mentions them)\n- Negative space (controversies, lawsuits)\n- Persona-based (search as journalist, recruiter, etc.)\n- Relationship network (find people who know them)\n\n**Goal:** Rescue stuck contacts by creatively reframing the search problem.\n        ",

Network Respect - good internet citizenship\n\nALIGNMENT ANALYSIS:\n\n\u2705 **WEIGHTED COORDINATION:**\nMeta-layer respects primary agents' weights. Only triggers when primary agents fail. Meta-insights feed back to weighted system. PERFECTLY ALIGNED.\n\n\u2705 **PATIENCE (Late Bloomer):**\nMeta-layer IS patience implemented! Instead of giving up on low-confidence contacts, system tries creative reframings. This is EXACTLY the late bloomer philosophy - \"keep bad branches alive long enough to see if they bloom.\" DEEPLY ALIGNED.\n\n\u2705 **SELF-DOCUMENTATION:**\nAll reframings logged with reasoning. Complete provenance chain. Shows \"Contact found via CreativeStrategist reframing #3.\" ALIGNED.\n\n\u2705 **RECURSIVE LEARNING:**\nMeta-layer insights feed back to primary agents. If \"Temporal Detective\" works, primary agents learn to search archives. System learns from its own debugging.
