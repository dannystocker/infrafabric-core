  "deepseek_response": "CONFIDENCE: 15%\nREASONING: Dr. Yann LeCun is a highly prominent figure in AI research with positions at both Meta and NYU. For individuals of his stature, publicly available direct professional email addresses are typically not provided due to high volumes of unsolicited contact and privacy concerns. While his institutional affiliations are public, both Meta and NYU would likely use automated systems or administrative staff to filter speaking requests. The most probable publicly available contact method would be through his professional social media accounts (LinkedIn/X) or institutional directory forms rather than a direct email address. For a formal conference invitation, the proper channel would be through Meta's press/events office or NYU's computer science department administration, not a direct researcher email.",
