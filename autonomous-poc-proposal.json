    "False positives (heuristic contact discovery may guess wrong emails)",
    "Privacy at scale (processing 84 public figures' data)",

  "philosophy": "This IS InfraFabric dogfooding itself. The system that documents itself will improve itself through this POC. The system that improves itself will discover late bloomers. The late bloomers will validate the patience principle.",
