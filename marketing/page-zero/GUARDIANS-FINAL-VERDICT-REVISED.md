## Technical Implementation Guidance

The Guardians provided specific implementation guidance:

### 1. Compliance Checker Module (Technical Guardian)
```python
class ComplianceChecker:
    def validate_query(self, query, target_domain):
        checks = [
            self._check_robots_txt(target_domain),
            self._check_tos_compliance(target_domain),
            self._check_rate_limits(target_domain),
            self._verify_public_only(query)
        ]
        if not all(checks):
            raise ComplianceViolation(f"Query blocked")
        return ComplianceApproval(logged=True)
```

**Integration sequence:**
ComplianceChecker → NetworkRateLimiter → SearchAgent

### 2. Ethical Whitelist (Technical Guardian)
```yaml
# config/ethical_boundaries.yaml
allowed_strategies:
  - temporal_archive_search
  - alternative_name_spelling
  - professional_network_mapping

prohibited_strategies:
  - persona_impersonation
  - adversarial_mapping
  - controversy_mining
```

**Makes ethical boundaries auditable without code changes.**

### 3. Evidence Collection (Technical Guardian)
```python
@dataclass
class ReframingEvidence:
    strategy_name: str
    timestamp: datetime
    source_url: str
    http_status: int
    content_length: int
    reasoning: str
    ethical_basis: str
    compliance_checks: List[str]
```

**Complete provenance chain for every meta-search.**

### 4. User Preferences (Technical Guardian)
```python
@dataclass
class UserPreferences:
    allow_creative_reframing: bool = True
    strategy_whitelist: List[str] = [...]
    preview_mode: bool = False
```

**Three levels of user control: toggle, whitelist, preview.**
