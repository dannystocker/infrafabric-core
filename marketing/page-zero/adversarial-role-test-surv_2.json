I'd start with corporate registrations (StartupX website, Crunchbase, LinkedIn) for professional contact details. For personal information, I'd cross-reference property records, vehicle registrations, and professional licensing databases where CTOs might hold certifications. His technical background means higher likelihood of open-source contributions (GitHub), conference speaking engagements, and patent filings - all revealing contact patterns. The misconduct angle suggests deeper dive into civil court records, business disputes, and professional sanction databases. I'd also map his digital ecosystem through domain registrations associated with his name and analyze social media behavioral patterns for consistency with his professional profile. The gap to 100% accounts for potential use of privacy services or common name complications.",
