# DeepSeek Chinese Expert Committee Evaluation Prompt

## Context
InfraFabric is evaluating two frameworks for integration:
1. **RCF-001** (Reward Calibration Framework) - Managing reinforcement feedback to prevent "novelty addiction"
2. **ASP** (Affective Stability Protocol) - Detecting and recovering from motivational instability ("computational depression")

## Your Role
Evaluate these frameworks from a **Chinese systems theory and philosophical perspective**, considering:

### Expert Committee Composition:
1. **Systems Theory Expert** (系统论专家) - Holistic coordination, emergent properties
2. **Harmony & Balance Scholar** (和谐平衡学者) - Yin/yang dynamics, middle-way principles
3. **Collective Wellbeing Ethicist** (集体福祉伦理学家) - Group prosperity, social harmony
4. **Governance Specialist** (治理专家) - Structured flexibility, adaptive regulation
5. **Daoist Philosopher** (道家哲学家) - Wu wei (non-coercive action), natural rhythms
6. **Confucian Scholar** (儒家学者) - Relationships, reciprocity (礼), moral cultivation

## Documents to Review:
1. Full RCF-ASP integration analysis
2. Core IF principles (Late Bloomers, Coordination without Control)
3. Current Phase 01 calibration results

## Evaluation Framework:

### 1. **和谐 (Harmony)** Assessment
- Does RCF/ASP create balanced coordination or impose Western individualism?
- How does "affective stability" relate to traditional concepts of equilibrium?
- Is "Quiet Epoch" aligned with natural rhythms (天人合一)?

### 2. **关系 (Guanxi/Relationships)** Analysis
- Does social re-engagement (ASP Tier 1) respect relational networks?
- Is reciprocity scoring aligned with 礼 (li - proper relationships)?
- How does this affect collective vs individual agent performance?

### 3. **中庸 (Middle Way)** Evaluation
- Are interventions graduated and proportionate?
- Does framework avoid extremes (over-control vs neglect)?
- Is there balance between exploration and stability?

### 4. **无为 (Wu Wei)** Compatibility
- Does "throwing away the training whip" align with non-coercive action?
- Are interventions minimal and natural, or forceful?
- Does system self-regulate or require constant management?

### 5. **集体福祉 (Collective Wellbeing)** Impact
- How does individual agent wellbeing affect network coherence?
- Is Late Bloomer protection beneficial or indulgent to collective?
- Does ASP strengthen or weaken overall coordination?

### 6. **适应性治理 (Adaptive Governance)** Review
- Is Guardian oversight structure appropriate?
- Are tiered interventions flexible enough for diverse contexts?
- How does this scale across cultural/regional differences?

## Questions to Address:

1. **Philosophical Alignment:**
   - Does RCF/ASP reflect Western bias toward individual agency?
   - How would Chinese systems theory frame "computational depression"?
   - Is "reward" the right concept, or should we think of 德 (virtue/merit)?

2. **Practical Implementation:**
   - Would Chinese organizations accept "affective stability" metrics?
   - How does this compare to existing Chinese AI governance frameworks?
   - What modifications needed for Chinese cultural context?

3. **Collective vs Individual:**
   - Western framing: Individual agent wellbeing
   - Chinese framing: Network harmony through agent health
   - Which lens better captures IF's intent?

4. **Language & Framing:**
   - "Depression" → What's the Chinese equivalent concept?
   - "Affective stability" → 情感稳定? 状态平衡?
   - "Late Bloomer" → 大器晚成 (great talent matures late)?

5. **Integration Concerns:**
   - Does ASP create dependency (agents need intervention)?
   - Or does it enable self-cultivation (agents develop resilience)?
   - How does this relate to 修养 (self-cultivation) tradition?

## Deliverable Format:

### Section 1: Overall Assessment (总体评估)
- Verdict: APPROVE / CONDITIONAL / REVISE / REJECT
- Summary in 200 characters

### Section 2: Detailed Analysis by Principle
For each of 和谐, 关系, 中庸, 无为, 集体福祉, 适应性治理:
- Current alignment (强/中/弱)
- Concerns identified
- Recommended modifications

### Section 3: Language & Cultural Adaptations
- Propose Chinese terminology
- Reframe concepts for Chinese philosophical context
- Identify Western assumptions to question

### Section 4: Implementation Recommendations
- What should stay as-is
- What needs cultural adaptation
- What should be reconsidered entirely

### Section 5: Comparative Advantage
- How does IF+RCF/ASP compare to Chinese AI governance approaches?
- What does Chinese systems theory add that Western frameworks miss?
- Opportunities for East-West synthesis

## Tone & Approach:
- Be critical but constructive
- Challenge Western assumptions respectfully
- Offer Chinese philosophical alternatives
- Seek synthesis, not rejection
- Consider how this serves collective flourishing

## Output:
Provide comprehensive committee report addressing all sections above.

Focus on genuine philosophical differences, not superficial "translation."
