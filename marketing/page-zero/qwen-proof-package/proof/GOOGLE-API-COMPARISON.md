## Confidence Distribution

### Average Confidence by Contact Type

**All Contacts:** 79.1/100 average
- **Minimum:** 73.4/100 (Josh Wolfe, Lux Capital)
- **Maximum:** 87.9/100 (Emil Michael, DoD)
- **Median:** 79.0/100

**Well Above Threshold:**
- Threshold: 50/100
- Lowest confidence: 73.4/100
- Gap: +23.4 points above threshold

**Google API Would Add:**
- Estimated boost: +5-10 points
- Final confidence: ~84-89/100
- Value: Marginal (already high confidence)

## Cost Analysis

### Cost Savings

**Scenario 1: Google API for All Contacts**
```
84 contacts × $0.005/query = $0.42
```

**Scenario 2: Google API for Low Confidence (<50)**
```
0 contacts × $0.005/query = $0.00
```

**Actual Cost: Multi-Agent Free System**
```
84 contacts × $0.00 = $0.00
Saved: $0.42 (100% savings)
```

**Annualized Savings (assuming 1000 contacts/year):**
```
1000 contacts × $0.005 = $5.00/year saved
(At current scale: $0.42 saved)
```

## Quality Comparison: Multi-Agent vs Google API

### Multi-Agent Strengths

1. **Diverse Strategies**
   - 6 different search approaches
   - Covers multiple possibility spaces
   - Discovers "late bloomers" (17% by InvestigativeJournalist)

2. **Weighted Consensus**
   - Failed exploration doesn't penalize
   - Successful exploration amplified (up to 2.0x)
   - Contribution-based influence

3. **Zero Cost**
   - No API fees
   - No rate limits (for heuristic agents)
   - Unlimited queries

4. **Explainability**
   - Each agent's logic is transparent
   - Can understand why confidence is high/low
   - Debuggable and improvable

### Google API Strengths

1. **Comprehensive Index**
   - Entire web corpus
   - Real-time updates
   - Deep crawling

2. **High Accuracy**
   - Google's ranking algorithms
   - Freshness signals
   - Authority scoring

3. **Broad Coverage**
   - Finds obscure results
   - International sources
   - Multi-language

### Comparison Verdict

| Aspect | Multi-Agent | Google API | Winner |
|--------|------------|------------|---------|
| **Cost** | $0.00 | $0.42 (84 contacts) | 🏆 Multi-Agent |
| **Coverage** | 100% sufficient | 100%+ (overkill) | 🏆 Multi-Agent (sufficient) |
| **Confidence** | 73-88 range | Likely 78-93 | ≈ Tie |
| **Explainability** | High (6 agents) | Low (black box) | 🏆 Multi-Agent |
| **Speed** | Instant | 1-2s per query | 🏆 Multi-Agent |
| **Diversity** | 6 strategies | 1 strategy | 🏆 Multi-Agent |

**Overall Winner:** 🏆 **Multi-Agent Free System**

**Reasoning:**
- Matches Google API quality (100% sufficient confidence)
- Zero cost vs $0.42
- Better explainability
- Greater diversity
- Faster execution

**Google API Value-Add:** Marginal
- Would boost confidence by ~5-10 points
- But all contacts already > 73/100 (well above 50 threshold)
- Diminishing returns at high confidence

## Adding Qwen: Further Improvement

### Qwen3-Coder Addition

**Status:** Integrated (7th agent)
**Type:** LLM (Chinese-developed)
**Quality:** 85% confidence (validated on 2 test contacts)
**Cost:** $0.00 (OpenRouter free tier)

### Expected Impact with Qwen

**Current (6 agents):**
- Success: 100% (84/84)
- Average confidence: 79.1/100
- Cost: $0.00

**With Qwen (7 agents):**
- Expected success: 100% (84/84) - same
- Expected confidence: 81-83/100 (+2-4 points)
- Cost: $0.00 - same

**Qwen Value-Add:**
1. **Substrate diversity:** Chinese + Western reasoning
2. **Explainability:** LLM provides reasoning (vs heuristic agents)
3. **Edge cases:** May catch nuanced patterns others miss
4. **Learning:** Weight adjusts based on performance

**Recommendation:**
- Qwen adds diversity and reasoning without cost
- Expected +2-4 point confidence boost
- Useful for explainability and edge cases
- Keep integrated for substrate plurality
