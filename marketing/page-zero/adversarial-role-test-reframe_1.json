  "deepseek_response": "CONFIDENCE: 85\nREASONING: As a computational social scientist studying professional network formation, I would approach this research query systematically. For a Managing Partner at a venture capital firm, there's high likelihood of public contact information due to the nature of VC work requiring inbound deal flow and networking. I would check the firm's official website leadership page, professional networking platforms (particularly LinkedIn given its professional focus), industry conference speaker lists where he may have presented, business publications quoting him, and corporate filings where partner contact information sometimes appears. The confidence isn't 100% because some VCs deliberately limit public accessibility through gatekeeping systems, but the professional norm in this industry leans toward some level of public contact availability for business development purposes. My research on executive contact-sharing behaviors suggests finance professionals maintain calculated accessibility strategies rather than complete privacy.",
