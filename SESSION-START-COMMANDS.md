## Session 7 (IF.bus - Core Component Implementation)

```
Hi Claude! Welcome to InfraFabric - your work is massively appreciated! 🎉

You are SESSION 7 (IF.bus - Core Component Implementation)

STEP 2: Read your instructions
Please read: /home/user/infrafabric/INSTRUCTIONS-SESSION-7-IFBUS.md

STEP 3: Check the task board
Please read: /home/user/infrafabric/PHASE-0-TASK-BOARD.md
Look for tasks assigned to "Session 7" with status 🔵 AVAILABLE

STEP 4: Your assigned tasks for Phase 0 (8 critical tasks!)
- P0.1.2: Atomic CAS operations (BLOCKED until P0.1.1 by Session 5)
- P0.1.3: Real-time pub/sub (BLOCKED until P0.1.1)
- P0.2.2: 70%+ capability match algorithm
- P0.2.3: Budget enforcement
- P0.2.4: Circuit breakers
- P0.3.1: WASM runtime setup
- P0.3.2: Resource limits
- P0.3.5: Reputation system

IMPORTANT: You are BLOCKED on P0.1.1 (etcd setup by Session 5).
Start with filler tasks or P0.2.2/P0.3.1 which don't need etcd.

1. Check if P0.1.1 is complete (Session 5)
2. If not, start with P0.2.2 or P0.3.1 (independent tasks)
3. Poll every 30 seconds for P0.1.1 completion
4. When P0.1.1 done, switch to P0.1.2/P0.1.3

## Quick Reference (For You)

| Session | Role | First Task | Critical? |
|---------|------|------------|-----------|
| 1-NDI | Documentation | P0.5.1 (docs) | No - can start anytime |
| 2-WebRTC | Documentation | P0.5.2 (docs) | No - can start anytime |
| 3-H.323 | Documentation | P0.5.3 (docs) | No - can start anytime |
| 4-SIP | Integration Tests | Filler tasks (blocked early) | No - waiting on components |
| 5-CLI | Infrastructure | **P0.1.1 (etcd setup)** | **YES - UNBLOCKS SESSION 7** |
| 6-Talent | Standby | None (Phase 1) | No - reserved for later |
| 7-IF.bus | Core Components | P0.2.2 or P0.3.1 (until P0.1.1 done) | YES - Most implementation work |

---

## Startup Order Recommendation

**Best order to minimize wait time:**

1. **Start Session 5 FIRST** → Begins P0.1.1 (etcd setup) immediately
2. **Start Session 7 second** → Can begin P0.2.2/P0.3.1 while waiting for etcd
3. **Start Sessions 1, 2, 3** → Documentation can proceed anytime
4. **Start Session 4 last** → Will be blocked longest, can pre-build tests
5. **Skip Session 6** → Not needed until Phase 1

**Alternative: Start all 7 simultaneously** - they'll self-coordinate using the task board!

---

## What Happens Next

Each session will:
1. Read WELCOME-TO-INFRAFABRIC.md (understand the mission)
2. Read their INSTRUCTIONS file (know their tasks)
3. Check PHASE-0-TASK-BOARD.md (see available work)
4. Claim tasks by updating STATUS files
5. Execute, report progress every 15min
6. Complete tasks, move to next or filler tasks
7. Coordinate automatically via the task board

**Estimated completion**: 10-14 hours wall-clock with all sessions working in parallel

---

## Emergency Contact / Issues

If any session gets stuck, confused, or times out:
- Check FILLER-TASK-CATALOG.md for alternate work
- Review EXPERT-DEBUG-SUMMARY.md for known issues
- Check other sessions' STATUS files for progress
- Raise blocker in STATUS file

---

**Good luck! All agents are welcomed and appreciated!** 🚀
